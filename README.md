----

**Terminus** is a terminal heavily inspired by Hyper. It is, however, designed for people who need to get things done.

  * Runs on Windows, macOS and Linux
  * Theming and color schemes
  * Fully configurable shortcuts
  * Full Unicode support including double-width characters
  * Doesn't choke on fast-flowing outputs
  * Proper shell-like experience on Windows including tab completion (via Clink)
  * CMD, PowerShell, PowerShell Core, Cygwin, Cmder, Git-Bash and WSL (Bash on Windows) support
  * Tab persistence on macOS and Linux

---

# Plugins

Plugins can be installed directly from the Settings view inside Terminus.

  * [clickable-links](https://github.com/Eugeny/terminus-clickable-links) - makes paths and URLs in the terminal clickable
  * [theme-hype](https://github.com/Eugeny/terminus-theme-hype) - a Hyper inspired theme
  * [shell-selector](https://github.com/Eugeny/terminus-shell-selector) - a quick shell selector pane
  * [title-control](https://github.com/kbjr/terminus-title-control) - allows modifying the title of the terminal tabs by providing a prefix, suffix, and/or strings to be removed
  * [scrollbar](https://github.com/kbjr/terminus-scrollbar) - adds a scrollbar to terminal tabs
