**Terminus** is a web technology based terminal heavily inspired by Hyper. It is, however, designed for people who need to get things done.

  * Runs on Windows, macOS and Linux
  * Theming and color schemes
  * Configurable hotkey schemes
  * **GNU Screen** style hotkeys available by default
  * Default Linux style hotkeys for Copy(`Ctrl`+`Shift`+`C`), and Paste(`Ctrl`+`Shift`+`V`)
  * Full Unicode support including double-width characters
  * Doesn't choke on fast-flowing outputs
  * Tab persistence on macOS and Linux
  * Proper shell-like experience on Windows including tab completion (thanks, Clink!)
  * CMD, PowerShell, Cygwin, Git-Bash and Bash on Windows support
